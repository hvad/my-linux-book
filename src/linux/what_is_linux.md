# What is Linux ?

From a technical standpoint, Linux is a Kernel—the core software that manages
the communication between your hardware (CPU, memory, storage) and your applications.

However, in the daily life of a SysAdmin, "Linux" refers to the entire ecosystem of 
open-source tools that run on top of that kernel to create a functional Operating System.

The 3 Layers of a Linux System:
- **The Kernel:** The invisible engine. It handles memory management, file systems, and hardware drivers.

- **The Shell:** Your primary interface. Whether it’s bash or zsh, the shell interprets your 
commands and passes them to the kernel.

- **The Distribution**: A packaged version of Linux. Since the kernel is open-source, 
different organizations bundle it with different tools, package managers, and desktop environments.
